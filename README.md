# library

A library book tracker that utilizes object constructors, classes, and localStorage!

## Project Requirements

1. Write a constructor for making “Book” objects. Your book objects should have the book’s title, author, the number of pages, and whether or not you have read the book
2. Create skeleton HTML/CSS and JS files. All of your book objects are going to be stored in a simple array, so add a function to the script (not the constructor) that can take user’s input and store the new book objects into an array.
3. Write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page.
4. Add a “NEW BOOK” button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: author, title, number of pages, whether it’s been read.
5. Add a button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library and a button to change its read status.
6. (optional) Add localStorage
7. Refactor it to use classes instead of object constructors
